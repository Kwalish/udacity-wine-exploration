Udacity's Data Analyst Nanodegree PART 5: Exploratory Data Analysis

This is my submission for Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree's Exploratory Data Analysis and the goal was to uncover insights from a wine dataset (more information here: https://s3.amazonaws.com/udacity-hosted-downloads/ud651/wineQualityInfo.txt).

Through this project, I tried to quickly get an understanding of the dataset and what makes a good wine.

I found out that many variables affect the quality of wines but most they affect red and white wines in different ways. 

The exception being alcohol which both affect red and white wine!
